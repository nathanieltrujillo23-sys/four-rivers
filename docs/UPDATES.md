# 4 Rivers: updates

Every batch of work is named and numbered, so we can talk about it by number. Newest first.

## Reminders (do later)

| What | Where it came from | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Founder video on the home page** (about 45 seconds from Nathaniel) | Update 1, idea 19 | Builds trust faster than any design change. Place it above "What you'll learn", with a captioned transcript for accessibility. |
| ESV and NLT keys | Bible versions work | Free keys at api.esv.org and api.nlt.to; add `ESV_API_KEY` and `NLT_API_KEY` in Vercel. Until then those versions fall back to the KJV with a note. |
| Email, translation, and sign-up protection setup | Update before Update 1 | Resend (`RESEND_API_KEY`, `REMINDER_FROM`, `CRON_SECRET`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`), `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, Supabase "Confirm email", Cloudflare Turnstile. Step by step in [sign-up-protection.md](sign-up-protection.md). |
| Restore drill | Backups work | Restore a backup into an empty scratch Supabase project once. See [backups.md](backups.md). |
| Account export and delete | Suggestion list | A button in Edit profile. Also what privacy laws expect. |
| A separate test Supabase project | Suggestion list | Lets browser tests run real sign-up, groups and admin flows. |

## Update 1: Sharp and Professional (2026-10-08)

A visual and structural pass so the site looks and feels like a finished product.

- **A stronger first screen:** a much larger headline with tighter spacing, the Genesis 2:10 quote directly under it, and the four streams that draw themselves in from the source.
- **A shorter home page** (about 4,500px instead of 12,500): promise, What you'll learn, How it works, See it in action, the founder's story (with "Keep reading my story"), Questions answered, and a closing invitation. The rivers' full Scripture and the contact card moved to a new **About** page (`/about`), linked from the menu and footer.
- **What you'll learn:** four river cards, each with one sentence about what you will be able to do.
- **See it in action:** three phone-framed screenshots of the real app, in English and Spanish, made by `tools/dev/capture-showcase.mjs`.
- **Questions answered:** six FAQs, in English and Spanish.
- **One icon set:** consistent line icons for features (`FeatureIcons.tsx`).
- **One type scale and one card style** used everywhere (`t-display`, `t-h1` to `t-h4`, `t-eyebrow`, `panel`, `page-stack`), with a one-page [style guide](STYLE-GUIDE.md).
- **Shimmering loading placeholders** instead of the word "Loading".
- **Gentle motion:** pages fade in as you move between them, home page sections rise as they scroll into view, and everything is off for visitors who prefer less motion.
- **Sharper brand images:** smooth-edged favicon, app icons (including a maskable one and an `.ico`), and the share card, all drawn by `tools/dev/make_brand_assets.py`.
- **Dark mode checked** page by page, with accessibility scans for the new About page in both themes.

Not part of this update: the CTA button hierarchy and the social-proof line near the top (ideas 1 and 4).
